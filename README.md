# redmInit
Initialize a redmine installation including database and dump it all to /tmp ready to be used as a skeleton redmine backup just after initialization.  I'm using this to initialize an export directory to be used with Docker and Octohost. YMMV

ignore the Dockerfile for now, I was using it for some experimentation

## Usage
`make run` 

you should have three containers running at this point 
http://127.0.0.1:10083
user: admin pass: admin
Iâ€™ve been going in toying with it a bit get it where I want it
you can make a plugins directory and install them here
`/srv/docker/redmine/redmine/plugins/`
then I backup the databases and the data folder for redmine,
thow it all away then stick it up in the cloud
